## 👨 Diego — The Aliado Hustler

- **Age**: 38
- **Location**: Lince
- **Service**: Electrician with 12 years of experience, works independently.
- **Profile**: Takes pride in his craft. Gets most of his clients via referrals or Facebook groups, but dislikes the inconsistency.
- **Habits**: Works Monday through Saturday. Responds quickly to calls and WhatsApp messages. Avoids wasting time on quotes that don’t convert.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Leads from Facebook are unreliable—people ghost or cancel last minute
  - Fake competitors undercut prices and do poor-quality work
  - Gets calls at all hours and wastes time quoting without certainty
- **Tech Behavior**: Lives on WhatsApp. Uses voice notes to confirm jobs. Uses Facebook for visibility, not for trust.
- **What makes a lead valuable**:
  - Real customer
  - Nearby location (doesn’t want to travel across the city)
  - Confirmed job, not just a quote request
- **Why he’d trust Aliado**:
  - Pre-qualified leads feel serious
  - Doesn’t have to post his personal number publicly
  - 2–3 solid jobs a day would stabilize his income
